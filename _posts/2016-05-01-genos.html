    <p class="project__copy">Genos is a genetic research product that puts users in charge of their own data. Their key difference in the market is sequencing more of the data from your DNA than other similar services, and giving the user complete control over who can use that data for research.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Problem</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">Current genetic sequencing products only analyzes ~2% of a personâ€™s DNA, and that data then is able to be sold to researchers without further consent from that person. Genos wants to give consent back to the user, where they will be in charge of their data, and can lease it to researchers if they want to be a part of their study.</p>
  
    <p class="project__copy">One of the largest problem genetic researchers have is finding the right candidates to bring into their studies. Genos wants to setup powerful tools that take away the pain points from researchers when recruiting for their studies.</p>
  
    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Finding the Right Participants</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">Due to privacy restrictions a researcher is not allowed to know the identity of their participants. This creates a problem when trying to follow up with a candidate and find out if they are a good choice for a study. Genos is able to bridge this communication gap by allowing for surveys to be sent out to their candidates and filter by both quantitative as well as qualitative data.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Managing your Study</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">From the large database of genomes that Genos has a researcher can setup a targeted query that allows for deeper filtering than other research tools currently available. These queries can send out invites to possible participants, and allow for follow-up qualitative surveys to be sent out for a better understanding of your participants.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Genetic News</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">From the perspective of the participant, both researchers and Genos marketing is able to send out news updates to users keeping them informed about breakthroughs in genetics. We helped create a unified news center that allows users to browse stories that may be interesting to them.</p>
