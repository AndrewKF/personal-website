    <p class="project__copy">Digital Promise is a nonprofit organization with the goal of helping every student reach their full potential. Our team partnered with Digital Promise to help create tools for teachers and education product companies to help students. Our goal with this project was to give faster access to quality education research and highlight effective strategies for developers to add into their products.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Problem</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">Digital Promise believes that every learner is unique. After witnessing how a “One-size-fits-most” curriculum wasn’t working for the majority of students, they began to dig into research. They found by understanding individual students, and customizing teaching plans based on their needs, it helped all students do better in school.</p>
  
    <p class="project__copy">While this helps solve problems for students, this puts a great deal of burden on educators. Digital Promise’s goal was to create a set of tools for teachers, and digital product creators so they could support more students faster. If it became easier to identify and support learner diversity, then each student could receive a better education in and out of the classroom.</p>
  
      <p class="project__copy">To work on this goal, Digital Promise reached out to the Oak Foundation to help fund research to support learner diversity. Their initial research, focused on early reading, showed improvements in the classroom when teachers took into account learner diversity in their lessons. For an additional round of funding Digital Promise partnered with our team to create a working prototype to show their funders how these principals could be used in a digital product.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Research</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">To get a better understanding of how this new research could help students we began interviewing product developers to better understand their pain points. Most services and applications target directly at classroom teachers, a new strategy Digital Promise was developing was to focus on education software development companies. For profit software developers have been building most of the software that goes into current K–12 curriculums. Focusing on this group could have a greater impact on the education community as they did not have a new tool to help them before.</p>
  
      <p class="project__copy">Up front we wanted to know how education products were being developed and what research was being done during their production. We learned that some forms of research were done, but rarely was there any efficacy to the findings. It was difficult for companies to find quality, actionable research in the time they were allowed. To combat this product teams would commonly look for a recent study in the news, or a hot new buzzword to focus on, as the basis for their product. This was mostly done out of need to find something actionable quickly. Going through peer-reviewed research articles is time consuming, and few teams had the budget to hire a full time researcher.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Access to Quality Research</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">To satisfy the needs of product teams—who needed to work quickly—we worked with researchers at Digital Promise to promote easy to digest research summaries. Each of these summaries was important to the subject that was being taught. They would give a general overview of what is important and suggest some strategies to help a student learn important concepts.</p>
  
    <p class="project__copy">Each of these learner summaries were not standalone in how they worked. If you improved on one skill, there were benefits that were seen in a network of other skills important to learning. To help keep product teams aware of this relationship we needed to display these connections and how they can impact each other. This allows users to focus on supporting a few specific skills or go after a diverse set of them based on their product scope.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Making Research Actionable</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">It wasn’t enough to just have broad research concepts to be understood to help education development companies. Each piece of research is tied to strategies and current case studies of they are used in the classroom. This gives developers a real sense of how their new product or feature can impact the education of a student.</p>
  
    <p class="project__copy">The eventual goal was to allow for users to be able to submit their product to be added as a case study. Allowing for community enhancements to be made would allow the resources to grow organically. Teachers and developers could comment on what strategies worked well in the classroom, giving the research a strong foundation for teachers to feel comfortable to bring the product into their classroom.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Consulting with Experts</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">During our research we also found that the most successful product companies had a rich network of peers and researchers. This network was a key part in their process. The feedback and guidance from experts in the field helped them stay focused on important features and kept them away from potential pitfalls. Creating a network of highly specialized researchers is a difficult challenge but we wanted to give product companies the ability to form new connections that could help them grow.</p>
  
    <p class="project__copy">We highlight experts who are leaders in their field so that developers could find more of their research or reach out to form a connection with someone who can help guide their process. To help support a network of peers we added tools for product companies and educators to discuss, rate, and submit new strategies that they use.</p>

    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Styling Updates</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">Digital Promise already had a few websites and blogs that had been built out with their current branding. But for this new project there were special considerations we needed to take. So far, none of the products they built before were responsive to screen size. Some updates were needed to their current styles to support different device sizes and capabilities. Also as a non-profit there are compliance needs surrounding accessibility that we were able to help them to create. Expanding their brand implementation to support a minimum of WCAG Level AA accessibility.</p>
  
    <h4 class="project__copy-head">Prototype for Demoing</h4>
    <p class="project__copy">For testing purposes we chose to use InVision for it’s easy to spin up prototypes and be something that could be updated later without too much additional work. In their pitches based on the current production application we are building they have been able to successfully raise their funding goals. This allows them to continue to build out quality tools for product teams and educators to help students learn.</p>
  
      <h4 class="project__copy-head">Production Ready Alpha</h4>
      <p class="project__copy">Digital Promise was excited about the feedback they received. After we delivered the  prototype they asked us to begin working on the next phase of building out the actual product. There were three needs that Digital Promise had for the first version of this tool:</p>
  
      <ul class="project__list">
        <li>Available as an iterative testing tool with users</li>
        <li>Expandable and reusable for future versions</li>
        <li>Able to show to donors for fundraisers</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p class="project__copy">We transitioned the team towards working on a production ready alpha release, using Angular as our framework and Contentful as our CMS. The Alpha version is currently being tested in a closed setting but they hope to release a free version to the public in 2018.</p>
