  <p class="project__copy">Ace Hardware delivers high quality shopping experiences at their many locally owned stores. Many of their customers continue to shop with Ace for their friendly stores, and trusted expertise when it comes to finding the right product for the job.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Problem</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Ace Hardware has a good reputation of being a great shopping experience, with expert know how and a community focus. But their digital presence did not have the same kind of expertise and friendliness for which their brand is known.</p>

  <p class="project__copy">Ace wanted to create a online platform to recommend products and give advice on home improvement projects. This hopefully would draw more people to local Ace Hardware stores to get supplies for their projects.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Expert Advice</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Ace wanted to create a modern web experience that allowed for a friendly feel with easily updatable content. We helped their team by building a Wordpress based add-on to their retail site. This allowed them to update featured content based current seasonal focuses that tied to their current shopping experience.</p>

<div class="outer">
  <p class="project__copy">Each post had rich labeling associations, allowing users to filter and find the right project for them. Posts also allowed for multiple content types as well. So if it didnâ€™t make sense to watch a video where you were you could use a text based version instead.</p>

<div class="outer">
  <p class="project__copy">Each project page has rich content showing the user what tools and materials are recommended linking the user to an product page on their website. The theme we built was fully responsive and had a light footprint ideal for mobile. This allowed for easy viewing while at home or when looking for products in the store.</p>
