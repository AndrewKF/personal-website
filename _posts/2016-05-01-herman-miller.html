  <p class="project__copy">Herman Miller is a leader in manufacturing American home and office furnishings. They have more than 100 years of experience creating innovative, environmentally responsible, ergonomic furniture. To help them build a new prototype for a their Living Office initiative, Universal Mind was asked to help bring their furnishings into a connected workspace.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Problem</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Herman Miller has been studying ergonomics for a long time now. Their research has shown that no matter how comfortable, or supportive a chair is, sitting for long periods of time is not good for the human body. It is important to strike a balance between sitting, standing, and being mobile. This leads to better health for employees—and usually—better productivity.</p>

  <p class="project__copy">At the same time, office managers for large companies don't have a reliable way of knowing how their workspace is being used. Herman Miller wants to give clarity to office managers and highlight how areas of the office are being used. This information can give clues to what adaptations offices need to be better for employee needs.</p>

  <p class="project__copy">Herman Miller wanted to test and see if both problems could be solved within their new Living Office initiative. A workspace that could help employees be healthier and a way to know what gets used in an office to help facility managers. Working with their current design partners, we set out to build desktop and native mobile applications for two audiences. The mobile application to help employees customize their workspace, and a management application to help understand office utilization.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Onboarding</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Our main task for this phase was a companion mobile app for their sit to stand workstations. This app would gently encourage users to utilize the standing functionality of the desk and take breaks throughout the day. Ergonomics experts working with Herman Miller recommended a varied work hour, and not only sitting at your desk. What we needed to do was encourage people to take breaks throughout the day, and to begin creating a routine that helps keep employees healthy.</p>

  <p class="project__copy">This started with getting a sense of how the employee already spends their workday. When on boarding to the application we would ask questions about how they spend their workday. These numbers would give us a good idea of what a person feels like they are doing, but a brief contextual inquiry study showed us that these numbers were usually higher then the actual figures. To get a better idea of how a employee actually spends their day we planned on using the first few days data to give us a better starting schedule for the user.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Working with the Desk</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Something we identified early was that the desk needed to operate like a desk even when it wasn’t connected. Too many times we have seen in the news about a IoT connected device that breaks the moment it looses it’s connection. Both the desk and chair would have the same usable functionality when they were disconnected to prevent frustration for employees. Where the app had the most amount of impact for users is saving preferences of the individual user.</p>

<div class="outer">
  <p class="project__copy">Considering the physical environment the employee would be in, it made more sense to have the actual desk notify the user then the mobile app. Not everyone has their phone directly in front of them while at work, and notifications on the phone would be too much of a distraction. Using the desk interface a subtle light would be used to notify the user if it was time to change positions. The employee could either accept or snooze the notification on the desk without needing to reach for their phone.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Office Statistics</h4>

  <p class="project__copy">Herman Millers corporate customers usually have a large amount of office space, and sometimes don’t know how the space is actually being used. Without knowing how employees are using their office spaces facility managers can’t adjust to the needs of the employee.</p>

  <p class="project__copy">Allowing smart workstations to self report information like repair status, frequency of use, and employee activity gives valuable data to office managers. This allows them to make informed decision when updating office space to adapt to it’s current use.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Testing our Assumptions</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">Taking the work we did and flow we felt confident that this was the time to test our assumptions and test with potential users. We organized an in person study with the prototype our team build and interview users to test; their understanding of what the app is trying to do and the clarity of instructions during on boarding.</p>
  <p class="project__copy">We found that most people understood the purpose of the application. The largest hurdle to cross in future iterations was to create a consistent habit that users would follow to be healthier during the workday. From our interviews we found initial excitement using other health and fitness trackers (such as fitness wearables and mobile apps) but usage typically fell within 2 months of use.</p>

  <h4 class="project__copy-head">Showcasing the Prototype</h4>
  <p class="project__copy">The working desk and applications were shown at 2016 NeoCon, the annual commercial design conference for furniture in Chicago. Herman Miller had a tremendous amount of interest in prototype and Fortune 500 companies willing to be a part of a closed beta in the coming year. Smart furnishings is still an ongoing project and production of the desk and chair begun in 2017.</p>
